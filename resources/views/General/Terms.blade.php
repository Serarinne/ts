However, by submitting Content to the Service, you grant WaifuWall.com a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content in connection with the Service and WaifuWall.com's business.</p>
        <p>This license is necessary for the Service to display and distribute your content to other users. The license terminates when you remove your Content from the Service.</p>
        <p>We strongly encourage all users to provide proper attribution to the original artist and a link to the source of the work upon uploading.</p>

        <ol>
